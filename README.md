# Members-Only

This project was created as part of The Odin Projectâ€™s Ruby on Rails Curriculum. The aim was to get some experience with implementing authentication systems in Rails so users can only access areas of a site they are authorized to.

Members-Only is an exclusive forum where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

Devise was used as the authentication solution for this Rails project.
